<h1>SEALS platform evaluation modalities for OAEI</h1>

<p>

The <a href="http://www.seals-project.eu">SEALS project</a> is
dedicated to the evaluation of semantic web technologies. To that
extent, it is creating a platform for easing this evaluation,
organising evaluation campaigns, and building the community of tool
providers and tool users around this evaluation activity.
</p>
<p>
OAEI and SEALS are closely coordinated in the area of ontology
matching. The SEALS platform covers other areas as well. We plan to
integrate progressively the SEALS platform within OAEI
evaluation. Starting in 2010, three tracks (benchmark, anatomy,
conference) will take advantage of the SEALS platform in its first
version.
</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>
The SEALS platform will be delivered in two steps to participants:
<ol>
<li>A preliminary version in which systems are evaluated as web
  services. This version allows participants to debug their system's
  interface from their own site and to check that it works
  well. Results are immediately available to participants.</li>
<li>The final version in which systems are deployed in the
  platform. This allows organisers to compare systems on the same
  basis, in particular in terms of run time. This is also a test of
  the deployability of tools.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Web service based evaluation</h2>

<p>
In its first simple presentation, the SEALS platform will allow
matchers to be evaluated as web services. Participants will thus have
to implement a very simple web service, provide its URL to the
platform and get results.
</p>
<p>
This first primitive version of the platform does only this. It does
not keep track of what has been done, does not provide extra support,
etc. It allows participant to be sure that they implement the correct
interface and test their system.
This will evolve with time and further services will be provided as
soon as they are available.
</p>

<p>
The instructions for implementing your matcher as a web service are
provided in
this <a href="http://alignapi.gforge.inria.fr/tutorial/tutorial5/">tutorial</a>. Following
the instructions in the tutorial will allow you to test whether you
correctly implemented the interface. It will also allow you to use a
first service of the SEALS platform to test your system.
It is highly advised to implement the second part of the tutorial (the
MyAlignmentWS part) so that your tool will be ready for the
deployment evaluation part.
</p>

<p>
The evaluation service is available
at <a href="http://seals.inrialpes.fr/platform/">http://seals.inrialpes.fr/platform/</a>. We are updating the functionality from time to time, in case of
problems do not hesitate to contact us.</p>

<p>
Processing an evaluating with the platform consists of providing the
name of the system, the endpoint (URL) of the web service and selecting the test set. Clicking on Submit will launch the evaluation.
</p>

</div>

<br>

<p>
Before starting an evaluation, some validation is done, in order to verify that the namespace and endpoint are correct and the tool delivers alignments in the correct <a href="http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2010/align.html">Alignment format</a>.
</p>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img align="center" src="images/seals-light-2.jpg">
</div>

<br>

<p>
If everything is ok, then the evaluation is launched and the evaluation results are shown.
</p> 

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img align="center" src="images/seals-light-4.jpg">
</div>

<br>

<p>For each alignment, details about the correct, incorrect and missing correspondences are provided.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Deployment-based evaluation</h2>

<p>
The deployment based evaluation relies on the Alignment API, so
matchers have to be made available under Java. Doing so is described
in detail in this <a href="http://alignapi.gforge.inria.fr/tutorial/tutorial3/">tutorial</a>.
However, if you have followed our advice above, then this is already
done.
</p>

<p>
Then, deploying a matcher on the SEALS platform may require additional
information than just a jar file. The SEALS platform allows for
defining the environment under which your system is run: Operating
system, installed databases or resources like WordNet, etc. 
Your system is provided as a bundled zip file in which a deployment
description file tells the platform what to do.
</p>

<p>More information about the bundle will be posted soon.</p>

<!--p style="color: red;">Cassia: more info on the bundle format?
<ol>
<li>Until July 10th: we have a simple bundle ready, then publish it here.</li>
<li>Then we wait for stable documentation (working with SQL and
  WordNet) and put a pointer here.</li>
</ol></p>

<p style="color: red;">I'd like to see here the minimal version of
  the bundling: XML file, empty scripts, everything already given to
  the participants.</p-->


<h2>Registration</h2>

<!--p style="color: red;">Cassia: update?</p-->

<p>
So far, there is no compulsory registration. It is still possible to
manifest your interest in the SEALS project and to pre-register your
tool for evaluation on the <a href="http://www.seals-project.eu/join-the-community">SEALS portal</a>
</a>

<p>
Later, for the participation commitment, it will be necessary to
register and to upload the tool in the SEALS platform.
</p>
